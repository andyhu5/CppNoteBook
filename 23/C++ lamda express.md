# lamda express

This is a C++ code snippet with some unusual syntax involving lambdas with attributes. Let me break it down:

```cpp
int main() {  
    auto l = [][[]] ([[]] auto) [[]] { return 13; }(1);
    return l;
}
```

This code uses:

1. A lambda expression with attributes (`[[]]`) in three different positions
2. Parameter capture with attributes
3. Immediate invocation of the lambda

Let's analyze each part:

- `[][[]]` - This is a lambda with an empty capture list `[]` followed by empty C++ attributes `[[]]`. Attributes can provide additional information to the compiler about how to handle code.
- `([[]] auto)` - This is the parameter list with a single parameter of type `auto`, also with an empty attribute.
- `[[]]` - Another empty attribute after the parameter list and before the lambda body.
- `{ return 13; }` - The lambda body that simply returns the value 13.
- `(1)` - Immediately invoking the lambda with the argument 1.

The whole expression creates a lambda function with various empty attributes, then immediately calls it with the value 1. Since the lambda ignores its parameter and always returns 13, the variable `l` is assigned the value 13, which is then returned from the `main()` function.

In normal C++ code, you wouldn't typically see so many empty attributes like this. This example seems to be demonstrating the syntactic possibilities of attributes with lambdas rather than serving a practical purpose.
