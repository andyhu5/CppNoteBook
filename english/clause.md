#  English clause 

An English clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate (verb) and expresses a complete or incomplete thought. Clauses are the building blocks of sentences and can function independently or dependently. Here’s a concise introduction to English clauses:Types of Clauses

1. Independent Clause (Main Clause)  
   - Expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.  
   - Example: She runs every morning.  
   - Contains a subject (She) and a predicate (runs every morning).
2. Dependent Clause (Subordinate Clause)  
   - Does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone. It depends on an independent clause to make sense.  
   - Often begins with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., because, although, if, when) or a relative pronoun (e.g., who, which, that).  
   - Example: Because it was raining, we stayed inside.  
     - Because it was raining is the dependent clause; it needs the independent clause we stayed inside to be complete.

Key Features

- Subject: The doer or topic of the clause (e.g., The dog in The dog barked).  
- Predicate: The action or state of being, including the verb (e.g., barked loudly).  
- Clauses can be combined to form complex or compound sentences using conjunctions (e.g., and, but, or) or punctuation like commas or semicolons.

Types of Dependent Clauses

1. Noun Clause: Acts as a noun (subject, object, etc.).  
   - Example: What she said surprised me. (What she said is the subject.)
2. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause): Describes a noun, often introduced by relative pronouns.  
   - Example: The book that I borrowed is on the table.
3. Adverb Clause: Modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb, often answering why, when, where, or how.  
   - Example: I’ll call you when I arrive.

Clause Combinations

- Simple Sentence: One independent clause.  
  - Example: I like coffee.
- Compound Sentence: Two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction or semicolon.  
  - Example: I like coffee, and she likes tea.
- Complex Sentence: One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses.  
  - Example: Although it’s cold, I’ll go for a walk.
- Compound-Complex Sentence: At least two independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses.  
  - Example: I wanted to attend the concert, but I stayed home because I was sick.
