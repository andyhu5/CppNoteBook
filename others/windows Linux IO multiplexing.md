Yes, Windows has API functions similar to the `select`, `poll`, and `epoll` system calls found in Linux for handling I/O multiplexing. Here are the main Windows equivalents:

### 1. `select`
Windows provides a `select` function that is similar to the Unix `select` system call. It's part of the Winsock API and can be used to monitor multiple file descriptors to see if any of them are ready for reading, writing, or have an exceptional condition pending.

```cpp
fd_set readfds;
FD_ZERO(&readfds);
FD_SET(socket, &readfds);

timeval timeout;
timeout.tv_sec = 5;
timeout.tv_usec = 0;

int result = select(0, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
if (result == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
} else if (result == 0) {
    // Timeout occurred
} else {
    // One or more descriptors are ready
}
```

### 2. `WSAPoll`
The `WSAPoll` function is a Windows-specific function that provides similar functionality to the `poll` system call on Unix-like systems. It monitors multiple file descriptors to see if any of them have an event pending.

```cpp
WSAPOLLFD fds[1];
fds[0].fd = socket;
fds[0].events = POLLIN;

int result = WSAPoll(fds, 1, 5000); // 5000 ms timeout
if (result == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
} else if (result == 0) {
    // Timeout occurred
} else {
    // One or more descriptors have events
}
```

### 3. I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)
Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) provide a highly scalable way to handle multiple I/O operations. IOCP is more similar to `epoll` in terms of efficiency and scalability, but it's implemented differently.

```cpp
HANDLE iocp = CreateIoCompletionPort(INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, NULL, 0, 0);
if (iocp == NULL) {
    // Handle error
}

// Associate a socket with the IOCP
CreateIoCompletionPort((HANDLE)socket, iocp, (ULONG_PTR)socket, 0);

DWORD bytesTransferred;
ULONG_PTR completionKey;
OVERLAPPED* overlapped;

BOOL result = GetQueuedCompletionStatus(iocp, &bytesTransferred, &completionKey, &overlapped, INFINITE);
if (result == 0) {
    // Handle error
} else {
    // Handle completed I/O
}
```

### 4. `WSAEventSelect`
`WSAEventSelect` allows an application to associate network events with a socket. This function is less commonly used compared to IOCP but can be useful for simpler applications.

```cpp
WSAEVENT event = WSACreateEvent();
WSAEventSelect(socket, event, FD_READ | FD_WRITE | FD_CLOSE);

WSANETWORKEVENTS networkEvents;
WSAEnumNetworkEvents(socket, event, &networkEvents);

if (networkEvents.lNetworkEvents & FD_READ) {
    // Read data is available
}

if (networkEvents.lNetworkEvents & FD_WRITE) {
    // Socket is ready for writing
}

if (networkEvents.lNetworkEvents & FD_CLOSE) {
    // Socket has been closed
}
```

### Summary
While Linux uses `select`, `poll`, and `epoll` for I/O multiplexing, Windows provides similar functionality through `select`, `WSAPoll`, and the more scalable IOCP mechanism. Each method has its own use cases, and IOCP is typically preferred for high-performance and scalable network applications on Windows.
